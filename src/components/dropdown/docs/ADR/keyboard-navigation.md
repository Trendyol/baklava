# Keyboard Navigation in Dropdown Component

## Status
Implemented

## Context
Dropdown components need to be accessible and support keyboard navigation to comply with accessibility standards and provide a better user experience. Users should be able to navigate through dropdown items using keyboard controls.

## Decision
Implement keyboard navigation with the following features:
- Arrow Down/Right: Move focus to next item
- Arrow Up/Left: Move focus to previous item
- Escape: Close dropdown
- Enter: Open dropdown and select focused item

## Implementation Details
```typescript
interface KeyboardEvents {
  'ArrowDown' | 'ArrowRight': () => void; // Focus next item
  'ArrowUp' | 'ArrowLeft': () => void;    // Focus previous item
  'Escape': () => void;                   // Close dropdown
  'Enter': () => void;                    // Open/Select item
}

// Focus management
private focusedOptionIndex = -1;

// Boundary checks
this.focusedOptionIndex = Math.max(
  0,
  Math.min(this.focusedOptionIndex, this.options.length - 1)
);
```

## Consequences

### Positive
- Improved accessibility compliance
- Better user experience for keyboard users
- Consistent with standard dropdown behavior
- Support for both arrow key directions (up/down and left/right)

### Negative
- Additional complexity in event handling
- Need to maintain focus state
- Additional testing requirements for keyboard interactions
