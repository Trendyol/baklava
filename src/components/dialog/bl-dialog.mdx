Dialogs inform users about a task and can contain critical information, require decisions, or involve multiple tasks.

## Design Rules

- By default a dialog contains a close button.
- A dialog should contain at least one content (text, image etc.).
- Dialogs are always centered on the page, with an overlay behind them that hides the page content.
- Only large buttons can be used in the action bar and there can be maximum 3 buttons (**primary**, **secondary** and **tertiary**).

To maintain usability level of dialog component:

- When the dialog sticks to the page edges and does not fit in its minimum size, it switches to mobile view and the buttons are lined up one after.
- Dialog can be dismissed by clicking backdrop or pressing Esc.

## Basic Usage

A basic dialog can be show by setting `open` attribute/property to `true` via HTML or JavaScript.

```html
<bl-dialog caption="Some title" open>
  <p>Some content</p>

  <bl-button slot="primary-action" variant="primary" size="large">Done</bl-button>
</bl-dialog>
```

<Canvas of={DialogStories.BasicUsage} />

## Dialog With Sticky Footer

For long content that does not fit on the page, the dialog action area remains sticky at the bottom of the dialog so that it appears on the page.

<Canvas of={DialogStories.DialogWithStickyFooter} />

## Dialog Sizing

The dialog doesn't have any default size, it will be fluidly sized regarding its content. You can give your own width and height style to your content.
But dialog keeps itself inside the viewport. So dialog can not be bigger than the viewport.

<Canvas of={DialogStories.DialogSizing} />

## Autofocusing elements in Dialog

By default, when you open a dialog, "close" button get focus automatically. But you can also auto focus on a dialog action this by using
`autofocus` attribute of the `bl-button`.

<Canvas of={DialogStories.DialogWithFocusedAction} />

You may also consider to autofocus user to an input inside the dialog.

<Canvas of={DialogStories.DialogWithFocusedInput} />

## Full-width dialog actions

It's possible to use full-width dialog buttons with small lines of CSS definitions.

```css
bl-dialog.full-width-actions bl-button {
  --bl-button-display: block;
  flex: 1;
}
```

In this case action button(s) will fill the row by sharing space equally if there are more than one actions.

<Canvas>
  <Story of={DialogStories.DialogWithFullWidthAction} />
  <Story of={DialogStories.DialogWithFullWidthActions} />
</Canvas>

## Preventing closing dialog

In some cases you may want to prevent closing dialog when user clicks on backdrop, built-in close button or presses Esc key.
You can listen `bl-dialog-request-close` event and use `event.preventDefault()` to prevent closing dialog.

Source of the initiator of this request can be found in `event.detail.source` property. It can be one of `backdrop`, `close-button` or `keyboard`.

```js
document.querySelector("bl-dialog").addEventListener("bl-dialog-request-close", event => {
  if (event.detail.source === "backdrop") {
    event.preventDefault();
  }
});
```
