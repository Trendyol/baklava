Notifications are messages that communicate information to the user.

## Design Rules

- Notification **has fixed width (396px)** by default.
- Notifications are **temporary** by default but can be set permanent.
- Temporary notifications are **dismissed automatically** after a certain period of time.
- Temporary notifications remaning time will stop when hovered.
- It can be dismissed by swiping up on mobile.
- Notification takes position on top on small screens, and on top right on large screens.
- Multiple notifications would be visible with a vertical stack. New notifications will come to top on large screens, and will come to bottom on small screens.

## Basic Usage

The `bl-notification` component is a versatile tool for displaying notifications. It exposes two public methods: `addNotification` and `removeNotification`.

The `addNotification` method accepts a notification object as a parameter and returns a notification object that includes the props, an id, and a remove method. The remove method is a wrapper that calls the `removeNotification` method with the id of the notification.

The `removeNotification` method accepts a notification id as a parameter and returns a Promise that resolves when the notification removal animation is complete.

### Adding a Notification

A notification could be added by calling the `addNotification` method with a [notification object](#notification-object).

<Canvas of={NotificationStories.AddExample} story={{ inline: false, height: "200px" }}></Canvas>

### Removing a Notification

A notification could be removed by calling the `removeNotification` method with the notification's id.

<Canvas of={NotificationStories.RemoveExample} story={{ inline: false, height: "200px" }}></Canvas>

#### Await for Removal

The `removeNotification` method returns a Promise that resolves when the notification removal animation is complete. This could be used to await the removal of a notification.

<Canvas
  of={NotificationStories.RemoveAwaitExample}
  story={{ inline: false, height: "300px" }}
></Canvas>

### Actions

A notification could have a primary and a secondary action. These actions are displayed as buttons on the notification.

<Canvas
  of={NotificationStories.PrimaryActionExample}
  story={{ inline: false, height: "200px" }}
></Canvas>
<Canvas
  of={NotificationStories.SecondaryActionExample}
  story={{ inline: false, height: "200px" }}
></Canvas>

#### Removing a Notification on Action Click

A notification could be removed by calling notification's remove method.

<Canvas
  of={NotificationStories.ActionsRemoveExample}
  story={{ inline: false, height: "300px" }}
></Canvas>

### Permanent

A notification could be permanent. Permanent notifications are not dismissed automatically. They could be dismissed by clicking the close button.

<Canvas
  of={NotificationStories.PermanentExample}
  story={{ inline: false, height: "200px" }}
></Canvas>

### Variants

A notification could have one of the following variants: info, success, warning, error. The variant changes the color of the notification.

<Canvas
  of={NotificationStories.VariantsExample}
  story={{ inline: false, height: "600px" }}
></Canvas>
