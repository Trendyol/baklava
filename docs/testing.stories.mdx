# Baklava Testing
> This guide will help contributors about how to test Baklava.

### Brief
- Our coverage percentage for tests is `100%`.
- To run tests, you can simply type `npm run test` and run.
- We are using [@open-wc/testing](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@open-wc/testing) to write tests. You can check [here](https://open-wc.org/docs/testing/helpers/) to have more information about how to write tests.
- We are using [playwright](https://playwright.dev/) to run our tests for `Chromium`, `Firefox` and `Webkit` with [@web/test-runner](https://modern-web.dev/docs/test-runner/overview/).
