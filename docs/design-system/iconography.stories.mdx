# Iconography

* All icons are provided as SVGs
* All icons are single color (Some have multiple layers with different opacity of same color)
* All icons has square canvas (By default 24x24)
* Icon names as in `snake_case`
* Icons are for decorative purposes. Don't use them as a data in your documents (like an instructive image)

You can check [icon component](/docs/components-icon--single-icon) for usage information and interactive demos.
