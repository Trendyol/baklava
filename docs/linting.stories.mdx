# Linters & Formatters

To keep a consistent codebase we use some linters and running them in our pipelines automatically.

Linters that we use are [`eslint`](https://eslint.org), [`stylelint`](https://stylelint.io) and
[`commitlint`](https://commitlint.js.org). When make a git commit, some staged files processed with linters (via
[`husky`](https://typicode.github.io/husky/)) to check some syntax issues. `eslint` run for `ts` and `js` files and
`stylelint` run for `css` files. Also we check commit message with `commitlint`. [More information about our commit
rules](/docs/documentation-commit-rules--page). If there are any issues commit will be
interrupted with the message.

Same rules also apply in pipeline flow for every push. In the pipelines, we run `npm run lint` which is doing same
checks for all of the files this time and makes sure this push doesn't break any coding rules that we have.

We also use [`prettier`](https://prettier.io) and `eslint` as a formatter to easily fix some linting issues. You can
run `npm run format` to fix some issues automatically. We don't run this command in every commit automatically because
we want to be in control what and why we are doing some fixes.
