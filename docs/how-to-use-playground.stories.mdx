# How to use playground?
Playground is a demonstration area for developers. It stays under the `playground` folder in the root. It helps you to test your features & components by eliminating the need for stories.

You can run it with `npm run serve`, then it builds project and run the build in `watch mode` at port `8000`. You can either create a `foo.html` file and work on it or simply use `template.html`.
It looks like this,

Every change in your `html` file will be served immediately. However, if you change your component, you should rebuild the project by using `npm run build`.
