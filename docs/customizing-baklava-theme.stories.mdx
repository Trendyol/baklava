# Customizing Baklava Theme

Baklava Design System provides a set of well defined components with some UX decisions. Baklava is not a generic UI library, so it doesn't intend
to provide a list of component that you can customize every part of it. Instead Baklava aims to provide a good and consistent UX for the applications
uses it.

But there are still many customization options in Baklava, those doesn't effect UX result of the components a lot. These are design tokens and a set of
design token definitions are named as a "theme". Baklava comes with a default theme that you can import from `themes/default.css` file and will provide
more soon (like a dark theme). But you can also create your own theme or extend/override some part of the default theme in your applications.

## Creating your own theme

You can simply copy our `themes/default.css` file to your codebase, change any of the CSS variables inside the file and put that CSS file on your document
instead of `themes/default.css` file. Like:

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="/syles/my-baklava-theme.css" />
<script type="module" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@trendyol/baklava@beta/dist/baklava.js"></script>
```

With this opportunity you can use all of the Baklava components with your own branding colors, own selection of Font or different sizing values.

## Extending default theme

If you want to change a small set of the design tokens, you may consider to extend default theme.

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@trendyol/baklava@beta/dist/themes/default.css" />
<link rel="stylesheet" href="/syles/my-baklava-theme.css" />
<script type="module" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@trendyol/baklava@beta/dist/baklava.js"></script>
```

With this, you can -for example- only override color pallette for your app and continue to use typography or spacing rules from the default theme.

## Using themes in a smaller scope

Our theme files are setting CSS variables on `:root` level. That means they are being set on document level. But since we are only talking about
classic CSS styling here, in some cases, it's perfectly fine to set a design token for a part of your document.

```html
<div class="hero">
   <bl-button>Get Started</bl-button>
</div>

<style>
.hero {
  --bl-primary-color: purple;
}
</style>
```

In this example we are an exceptional part in our document that we want to make a primary button that is different then our theme colors. So we
set `--bl-primary-color` variable on `.hero` element and make primary button inside this element in a different color.

But you need to be careful about setting a design token in a scope, because in the example below, if I put a `bl-badge` component inside `.hero`
element, that will also use same color we set instead of our theme color. But of course you can easily address that kind of issues, like:

```css
.hero bl-button {
  --bl-primary-color: purple;
}
```

This opportunity gives a big power for handling esceptional use cases like:

* Using dark theme in a part of your document (like header or footer)
* Having more color or spacing options inside your app.

## Changing default styles of components

In addition to setting design tokens, some of our components has their own CSS custom properties to make customisation on their style. And if you want
you can use those custom properties in your theme definition to make all of those components in a desired style troughout your app.

For example, our badge component has `--bl-badge-color` property and by default it uses `--bl-color-primary`. If you want you can use a different default
color for all of the badges on your app by just adding:

```css
:root {
  --bl-badge-color: purple;
}
```

Using design tokens here is of course also possible:

```css
:root {
  --bl-badge-color: var(--bl-color-success);
}
```
