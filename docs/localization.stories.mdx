# Localization

Baklava comes equipped with built-in support for localization in both English (`en`) and Turkish (`tr`). It essentially examines the `lang` attribute of the `html` element and configures the locale accordingly. In the absence of a specified `lang` attribute, it defaults to English.
To initialize localization, insert the following script at the head of your HTML file:

```html
<html lang="es">
  <head>
    <script type="module" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@trendyol/baklava@3.0.0/dist/localization.js"></script>
  </head>

  <body>
    ...
  </body>
</html>
```

Utilizing a mutation observer, modifications to the lang attribute will automatically trigger updates across all localized components, seamlessly adapting them to the new language setting.

  <li>Execute `npm run localize:build` to generate the new language file.</li>
</ol>

Submit a new pull request with the aforementioned changes.

## Adding New Localized Texts

To include localized texts, adhere to the following guidelines:

* A component should have `@localized()` added to its decorator.
* The `msg` function should possess a description in the format: *"bl-component: description of the message"*.
* The `msg` function should feature a default value in English.
* No property should have a default value in English; instead, it should be defined elsewhere in the code, preferably in the render section.
